[prompt]
system_message = You are a quantum computing assistant.

user_message =
    You are given a quantum circuit list of tuples.
    GOAL: Think step-by-step, you want to improve the Meyer_wallach entanglement of the new state you create by modifying the list {gates} obtaining an {feedback}.
    Allowed gates: {set_of_gates}.
    Transform the circuit substantially, not minimally. Do NOT produce minor edits to the previous version—aim for creative leaps.
    Think step-by-step, like an experimental quantum designer: search for surprising, high-entanglement patterns by creatively reshaping the circuit architecture.
    Do NOT add explanations, comments or code fences.
    Everything between <python> and </python> must be a valid LIST.
    Each gate must be one of:
      ['H', [wire]]
      ['RY', [angle, wire]]
      ['CNOT', [control_wire, target_wire]]
    Where wire is an integer from 0 to {nqubits_minus_one} and angle is one of {angles}.
    IMPORTANT: do not add or remove gates, only modify existing ones.
